Finestra Virtual Desktops is an elegant solution to managing many windows or tasks on Windows. It allows you to divide your workspace up into multiple "virtual" desktops, each of which is easily accessible on the fly. For example, you can keep all of your internet applications open on one desktop, work on another desktop, and games on a third.

Finestra virtual desktops is also well known for taking advantage of Windows' live window thumbnails to show you live previews of your windows when viewed from the fullscreen "switcher" view. If you have Windows 7, Finestra also utilizes the new taskbar features to make the experience even more natural and enjoyable.

But wait! What if you still are using XP? Don't worry, Finestra Virtual Desktops provides support for XP as well, although window previews are not "live" since XP doesn't have DWM.

Finestra Virtual Desktops is developed and managed by [Z-Systems](http://www.z-sys.org/), which also produces a few other fine commercial and open-source projects.
